    Welcome to the English auction training app

<p>In the following, you can participate in up to 100 English auctions. In each auction you bid against another bidder. The role of the other bidder is taken by a computer.<br/><br/>
The price clock starts at a price of $200. Each second the price decreases by $1. The bidder who drops out last wins. The price is equal to the price that was displayed on the price clock when the first bidder dropped out.<br/><br/>
Before each auction your costs are drawn from a random distribution. The lowest cost you can have is $100 and the highest cost you can have is $200. If you win, your profit is equal to the difference between price and your costs. If you do not win, your profit is $0. </p>
